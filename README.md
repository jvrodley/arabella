"# arabella" 

This project was conceived in the wake of the Social Network Hackathon.  All the work on this project, investigation, documentation and coding is documented in the github repository at <link>.  The history of what work was done when can be seen there in its entirety.  As per hack rule and tradition, all coding was left for the period of the hack itself.  

However, much of the prep-work including documentation and design was pre-loaded (see the github history).  If that negatively affects our hack score, c’est la guerre, we’re prepared to take the hit.
